title: "Setting up a different nfcore pipeline"
---

For this section, we would like you to test out a different pipeline from [nf-core](https://nf-co.re) that might be appropriate for your research. We are here to support you in this session.

## Things to think about

1. Is the pipeline maintained?
2. What do you need as input?
3. What are some of the constraints you might face during the setup?
