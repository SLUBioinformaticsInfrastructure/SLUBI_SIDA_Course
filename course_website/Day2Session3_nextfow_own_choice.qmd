title: "Setting up a different nfcore pipeline"
---

For this section, we would like you to test out a different pipeline from [nf-core](https://nf-co.re) that might be appropriate for your research. We are here to support you in this session.

## Things to think about

1. Is the pipeline maintained?
2. What do you need as input?
3. What are some of the constraints you might face during the setup?

::: {.callout-note}

To test the settings of a pipeline it is advisable to run the pipeline on only a few, reduced samples to save on computation time. 

Once you are sure that the pipeline is set up correctly you can then run on the full data set.
