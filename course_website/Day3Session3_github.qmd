title: "Project Management with GitHub"
---

To get started with GitHub in VS Code, you'll need to install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), [create a GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github) and install the [GitHub Pull Requests and Issues extension](vscode:extension/GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github).

::: { .callout-note}
As of March 2023, GitHub required all users who contribute code on GitHub.com to enable one or more forms of two-factor authentication (2FA). [Here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication) is the step by step how-to enable two factor authentication. 

[Here](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/#multi-factor-authentication) is another summary, plus suggestions which software to use.

::: {.callout-note}
A **repository** in GitHub is where you can store your code, your files, together with their revision history. Repositories can be public or private, and might have several collaborators.
:::

## git

>Git has three main states that your files can reside in: modified, staged, and committed:

>- Modified means that you have changed the file but have not committed it to your database yet.
- Staged means that you have marked a modified file in its current version to go into your next commit snapshot.
- Committed means that the data is safely stored in your local database.

> [source: git documentation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F)

This leads to the three main sections of a Git project: the working directory, the staging area, and the Git directory (or repository).

And the basic commands of git: 

![Basic git commands](figures/git_and_github/git_commands.png){.class width=50%}

::: {.callout-note}
These basic operations are all done on your local system. You have the entire history of the project on your local disk, and do not need an internet connection to work on your data with git. You can do all your commits on your local computer and later push them to a remote repostitory, like Github.
:::


## Create a new repository on Github

Go to [www.github.com](https://github.com/), and sign in if you haven't done so yet. On your profile page klick on the tab `Repositories` (if you are not on your profile you can navigate there by clicking on the icon in the top right corner).

Then create a new repository by clicking on the green button `New`:

- Choose a repository name - there will be a green checkmark if the name is available. 
- (optional) Add a short description of the repository contents.
- Choose if the repository should be public or private.
- Add a README (remember, good data management practices?)

Click on the green button `Create repository` to create repository.


::: {.callout-note}
A **public repository** is visible to anybody. People can also copy `clone` the repository and then change code in their copy. However, they cannot change the code in your repository unless you give them permission or make them collaborators.

A **private repository** is only visible by you and people you gave permission to.

## Add files to repository on Github

You can add files to the repository by clicking on the button with the plus, `+`. You can either click `Create new file` and edit it on the Github page directly, or `Upload files` from your computer. 

::: {.callout-note}
Whenever you save a file on Github, it automatically creates a commit that will be part of the repository history. 
:::

## Add files on your local computer

To change the content of the repository on your local computer you need to copy the repository content to your local computer. This is called `cloning`.



![Interface to clone a repository](figures/git_and_github/clone_repo.png)

- Click on the green `Code` button and select `SSH` on the `Local` tab. 
- Copy the URL to the clipboard. 
- **Open VScode** and type ``> Git: Clone` into the search bar. 
- **Copy in the URL you just copied from Github**. 
- Follow the prompts to **select a location** for the directory on your computer. 
- **Open the repository** with VScode. 

Now you can add files, edit and execute your code. Once you are satisfied with the changes you can `stage`, `commit` and `push` them. 

::: {.callout-tip }
You can now for example add a quarto homepage to your repository, so you have an interactive document to run and publish your analyses. Have a look at the [quarto section, `Creating a Project`](Day3Session2_quarto.qmd) of this course to see how. 
:::

## Stage, commit, and push

To add your changes to the repository history you can either use the command line in the terminal of VScode, or the shortcut on the side panel on the left of the VScode window that looks like three circles that are connected by two wiggly lines:

![The source control button in the sidebar](figures/git_and_github/sidebar_git.png){.class width=50%}

Here is a little reminder of what we are trying to achieve: 

![Basic git commands](figures/git_and_github/git_commands.png){.class width=50%}

### via the command line

In the terminal of VScode, check the status of your project with `git status`. 

![git status example](figures/git_and_github/git_status.png){.class width=70%}

There are a few files that are already tracked by git, but that have untracked changes, and a few files that are not tracked. (There is also one commit that is not yet pushed to the remote repository.) At the bottom it even says which commands to use to stage and commit changes.

Now, I can stage the files with `git add <filename>`.
