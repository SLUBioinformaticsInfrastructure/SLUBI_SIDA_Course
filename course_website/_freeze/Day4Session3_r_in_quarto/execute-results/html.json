One of the most commonly used languages in bioinformatics is R, and we wanted to show you some neat tips and tricks that we use often to make things a bit easier. Of course, please have a look at the [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz) book for more practical tips. \n\nWhat we are showing you here works just as well with R Markdown, so if you are already using that, or would prefer to work in the R GUI, please feel free to do so.\n\n## Code in R\n\nIn R, you have the option of working in the `console`, in an `R script` or in an `R Markdown` (among many options). Within the console, you execute code bit by bit. Within an R script you can execute code line-by-line, in sections, or as a whole. In R Markdown, you create a `chunk` that you can also execute line-by-line or as a whole block. In Quarto, you will use chunks as well.\n\nA chunk is a bit of code surrounded by backticks. A single backtick `highlights things` like this. A chunk is started with 3 backticks, filled with code, and closed with 3 backticks. You also indicate the language you will code in with curly brackets and the language you want to use.\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\nIf you add a fullstop in front of the language, your code is shown but it is not executed\n{r} would run an R chunk, but {.r} would not\n:::\n\n### Suppressing warnings\n\nR produces a lot of warnings! Sometimes these warning are useful, but most of the time, they aren't useful for us. If we look back at yesterday's example of running R in Quarto:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npacman::p_load(tidyverse, palmerpenguins)\n\nggplot(\n  data = penguins,\n  mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)\n) +\n  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = species, shape = species)) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_smooth()`).\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Day4Session3_r_in_quarto_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThere are 2 warnings about removing 2 rows. There are also some warnings about the libraries. \n\nTo remove these for a whole document, you can add this to the `title` section of your page to apply only to the page it is on (the title would be your title, this title is just this page's title):\n\n```{.bash}\ntitle: \"Using R in Quarto\"\nwarning: false\n---\n```\n\nYou can also silence warnings for particular blocks (because sometimes you might care about the warnings!) In that case, you would add this in the first line of your chunk:\n\n```{.bash}\n#| warning: false\n```\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npacman::p_load(tidyverse, palmerpenguins)\n\nggplot(\n  data = penguins,\n  mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)\n) +\n  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = species, shape = species)) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Day4Session3_r_in_quarto_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n",
